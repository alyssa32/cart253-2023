I am the developer and designer of this project. To draw the assets, I used PixelArt.com.

The goal of the game is to last as long as you can without letting a tulip wither away, while simultaneously avoiding touching any bees. The bees are not evil, they actually help the flowers grow as well but you just have an allergy to them.

While creating this game, I have come across many bugs. Some I was able to fix, for example the tulips' y would increase drastically when a bee would pass over it. Turns out I had mis-spelled "height" to "heigtht". However, there are other current bugs that I am currently stuck on. For example, the cursor does not react when collided into a bee.

Ideally, my game would have different coloured tulips (red, yellow, and blue) as opposed to just red. Next, when a bee collides with the cursor, a second end screen would be displayed (one which is already created but I had trouble calling). Lastly, when the mouse is pressed on a tulip, only that tulip would grow as opposed to all of them.
