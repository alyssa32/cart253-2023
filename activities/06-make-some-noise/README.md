# Make Some Noise

I could not think of a way to impliment sound to move characters within my final project, so I will have the player switch scenes by using their voice instead. Just like this exercise, once the user has read the instructions, they will have to make some noise loud enough for the simulation to switch onto the next scene.
Finally, to get to the end screen, the player must press the "enter" key.Ideally, it would have been cool to have all scenes switched by the audio input only, but I would not want the player to make noise during the game and instantly skip to the end scenes.
