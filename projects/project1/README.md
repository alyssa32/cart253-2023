# Runaway Chickens

By Alyssa Durdey

By using the arrow keys, the player must control the chicken to get to its chick. Taking turns, the chicken can only move one square at a time, whilst the chick randomly moves one space diagonally. However, both the chicken and the chick must avoid the farmer, who moves two spaces at a time in any direction.
